# Sources, GitHub, GitLab and Mirroring and all that good stuff

Repositories on GitHub are now for issues only. I've set up my own installation of GitLab and moved all my repositories over to [Git.Griefed.de](https://git.griefed.de/users/Griefed/projects). Make sure to check there first for the latest code before opening an issue on GitHub.

For questions, you can always join my [Discord server](https://discord.griefed.de) and talk to me there.
